## Were they on star trek!?

This is a website that is largely just from my own curiosity as a Star Trek and general TV/Movie watcher.

It happened by me remembering if I saw a character from Better Call Saul (and Breaking Bad), Tuco Salamanca (played by Raymond Cruz) anywhere in Star Trek.

This guy on the left over here:

Well, turns out he had a small role in [Star Trek Deep Space 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine)!

Its always interesting to see how many actors got their breaks on Star Trek.

## How it works

Enter in whatever show or movie you're curious about, and the site will list out any intersecting actors between said show and the Star Trek universe at large.
