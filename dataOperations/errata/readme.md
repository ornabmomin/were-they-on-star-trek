A dump of json that showcases characters not yet covered by the star trek memory alpha wiki

Many of these might be truly incorrect or the name on TMDB might not correspond to the canonical name as listed on Memory Alpha. Luckily TMDB allows modifications to names, so over time we can slowly normalize the names listed here to the ones that are canonical.

An example of this is the situation occurs in the ranks for characters such as "Ensign Ro". This person eventually becomes "Lieutenant Ro". In this case the best course of action is to edit the TMDB entry for the character and make it simply [Ro Laren](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ro_Laren)
